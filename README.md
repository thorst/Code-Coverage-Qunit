Code-Coverage-Qunit
====================

###About
This is a sample project. It literally took me 3 days to figure out how to put this together. Sort of pathetic. My hang up was coveralls. 
There are several different examples out there, none using everything I was, and none of it documented well.

Hopefully this will help someone. 

I intend on doing other samples.

Packages:
* Grunt		- Automated builds
* Qunit		- Testing (others: jasmine, mocha, karma)
* Instanbul - Code Coverage (others: blanket)

Services:
* Travis
* David
* Coveralls

###Ideas
If you have a different setup that you have working let me know and I'd like to setup a sample.

Also if you see something I'm doing that isnt needed please let me know. I'd like to pair this down as far as I can.

###Using
1. Fork and clone the repo.
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies (including grunt).
1. Run `grunt` to grunt this project.
